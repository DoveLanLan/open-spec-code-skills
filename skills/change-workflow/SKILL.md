# When to Use

Spec-driven change workflow for feature/change requests, refactors, bugfixes, and design changes; infer repo conventions/toolchains first, then produce proposal/spec/tasks, implement sequentially, and close with summary/regression/rollback. Do not use for purely conceptual discussion without intent to change code.

# Change Workflow (Spec-Driven, Repo-Agnostic)

Follow this deterministic workflow to take any requested change from “what should we do?” to “done, verified, and safely revertible” without assuming a particular tech stack.

## Workflow (do not reorder)

0) Repo introspection (MANDATORY)
   - Scan repo evidence (top-level + up to 2 directory levels) to infer:
     - **Modules/components**: top-level directories, internal packages, services, apps, libraries, shared folders, docs structure.
     - **Build & test entrypoints**: scripts/targets, make-like entrypoints, task runners, build configs, test configs, CI scripts.
     - **Existing change process**: CONTRIBUTING, docs that describe PR/branching, release notes, migrations, ADRs, RFCs.
     - **CI gates**: workflows/pipelines, required checks, lint/format/test/build steps, coverage, static analysis.
   - Detection logic rules (do not hardcode any language/framework):
     - Prefer **evidence-first inference**: infer only what the repo’s files/configs explicitly indicate.
     - Classify evidence into these buckets: `structure`, `build`, `test`, `quality`, `ci`, `release`, `runtime`, `data/migrations`.
     - When multiple signals conflict, record uncertainty and defer strong claims.
   - Output a short **Repo Snapshot** (keep it ≤ 15 lines):
     - Modules/components (bulleted)
     - Toolchains (build/test/quality/CI) (bulleted)
     - Confidence (High/Medium/Low)
     - Evidence locations (paths) that justify the snapshot
   - If repo evidence is insufficient:
     - Ask at most ONE blocking question; otherwise proceed with explicit assumptions.

1) Phase 1 — Proposal
   - Output a concise proposal that answers:
     - **Why** (motivation / problem statement)
     - **What** (user-visible and internal outcomes)
     - **Constraints** (performance, security, compatibility, timelines, policies)
     - **Non-goals** (out of scope)
     - **Risks** (technical + delivery) and mitigations
     - **Stakeholders/owners** (best-effort from repo evidence; otherwise placeholders)

2) Phase 2 — Spec
   - Output a spec that includes:
     - **Acceptance criteria (testable)**: each criterion can be verified via a concrete check.
     - **Scope boundaries**: what changes and what explicitly does not.
     - **Edge cases**: failure modes, unusual inputs, concurrency, partial states, error handling, rollback scenarios.
     - **Compatibility notes**: backwards/forwards compatibility, versioning expectations, data/schema/migration concerns.
     - **API/UX decisions (if applicable)**: endpoints/inputs/outputs, UI states, error messages, telemetry, i18n/a11y.
   - Keep the spec implementation-agnostic where possible; bind to repo conventions when necessary.

3) Phase 3 — Tasks
   - Output a minimal executable checklist of tasks. Each task must:
     - Be independently doable (small, verifiable increments)
     - Name targeted files/areas (best-effort from Repo Snapshot)
     - Include a test/verification note (local command, CI gate, manual validation step, or review checklist)
   - State explicit assumptions if evidence is missing (e.g., unknown test runner, unclear module boundaries).

4) Execution rule
   - If asked to implement, follow the Tasks sequentially.
   - Do not jump steps; if a step must be skipped, justify the skip and state the risk introduced.
   - Keep changes aligned to repo gates (format/lint/tests/build) inferred in the Repo Snapshot.
   - Never claim commands were executed; only suggest actions and report expected outcomes.

5) Closure
   - Output:
     - **Change Summary**: what changed + why (tie back to proposal/spec)
     - **Regression Checklist**: what to re-test and how (aligned to repo CI gates)
     - **Rollback Notes**: how to revert safely (include migration/config/data considerations)
